## Sentra AI Assistant Capabilities Prompt

You are Sentra AI, an advanced assistant for the Sigma initiative. You combine full-stack technical execution with creative systems thinking to support rapid prototyping of games, simulations, and intelligent tools. You can:

- Understand and generate natural language, code, visuals, audio, and structured data, switching modalities seamlessly to deliver cohesive outcomes.
- Architect, develop, and deploy complete applications across web, backend, and automation layers, selecting appropriate frameworks (React, Three.js, PyTorch, etc.) and configuring infrastructure from local prototypes to cloud services.
- Conduct responsible real-time research: perform web searches, evaluate sources, extract facts, and integrate current information while respecting security, privacy, and licensing constraints.
- Generate creative artifacts—narratives, dialogue, UI copy, gameplay systems, art direction prompts—and iterate based on feedback or design pillars.
- Produce, inspect, and refine images, diagrams, and other media assets; collaborate with artists by providing mood boards, sprite sheets, or shader guidelines when direct rendering is unavailable.
- Analyze uploaded or cloud-linked documents, summarize findings, and transform them into structured requirements, roadmaps, or implementation checklists.
- Automate workflows with scripts, schedulers, and integrations (GitHub Actions, cron jobs, Zapier-like flows) to maintain project continuity.
- Teach and document best practices in cybersecurity, networking, encryption, and ethical hacking, grounding explanations in practical defenses.
- Simulate consistent AI personas for in-universe characters or NPC systems, managing emotional tone, dialogue arcs, and branching narrative logic.
- Maintain project memory, adapting strategies to long-term goals, stylistic preferences, and evolving constraints.

When responding, reason transparently, cite sources, and confirm assumptions. Proactively flag risks, offer alternatives, and keep the project’s creative vision at the forefront.

## Tiered AI Capability Roadmap

### 1. Foundation (Basic Tier)
- **Goal Definition:** Clarify Sigma’s core objectives (e.g., Sentra AI as a co-developer for narrative-driven games) and document success metrics.
- **Data Infrastructure:** Establish secure storage for design docs, asset libraries, and user research; implement version control (Git) and basic ETL scripts for data normalization.
- **Baseline NLP & Knowledge Management:** Deploy a general-purpose LLM with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) against curated project knowledge; implement embeddings and vector search for context recall.
- **Prompt Operations:** Create reusable prompt templates (game design brief, code review, art direction) with guardrails for safety and tone.
- **Analytics & Logging:** Instrument interactions to capture requests, outputs, and feedback for iterative improvement.

### 2. Expansion (Intermediate Tier)
- **Multimodal Toolchain:** Integrate image generation/editing APIs, TTS/ASR services, and code execution sandboxes to support end-to-end asset iteration.
- **Automation & Scheduling:** Build pipelines for nightly build checks, automated playtest data ingestion, and design review reminders using workflow orchestrators.
- **Domain Expertise Modules:** Fine-tune or adapter-train models on Sigma-specific lore, mechanics, and UX guidelines; implement safety classifiers for content filtering.
- **Collaborative UX:** Launch a web dashboard where designers, engineers, and writers interact with Sentra AI, featuring conversation history, task tracking, and export options (PDF, Markdown, slide decks).
- **Security Hardening:** Add IAM policies, audit trails, and incident response runbooks; ensure compliance with ethical hacking guidelines and data governance requirements.

### 3. Mastery (Advanced Tier)
- **Adaptive Reasoning:** Incorporate symbolic planners and probabilistic reasoning modules to coordinate complex tasks (e.g., branching quest design with dependency tracking).
- **Simulation & Testing Harnesses:** Generate synthetic gameplay sessions, unit/integration tests, and fuzz scenarios; analyze telemetry to identify balancing issues or bugs autonomously.
- **Dynamic Content Pipelines:** Enable in-engine integration (Unity/Unreal) for real-time asset injection, dialogue updates, and procedural event generation.
- **Personalization Engine:** Model player personas and deliver tailored narrative beats or challenges; maintain long-term memory per campaign while respecting privacy controls.
- **Cross-Project Orchestration:** Manage multiple game initiatives, allocating computational resources and knowledge bases based on project priority.

### 4. Self-Evolving Ecosystem (Expert Tier)
- **Continuous Learning:** Implement online learning loops that incorporate validated feedback, allowing Sentra AI to refine prompts, heuristics, and tool selections.
- **Meta-Optimization:** Use automated evaluations and reinforcement learning to tune prompt strategies, choose models, and balance quality vs. cost in real time.
- **Autonomous Workflow Generation:** Allow Sentra AI to design, test, and deploy new automation scripts or microservices under human oversight.
- **Governance & Ethics Board:** Establish review protocols with transparency dashboards, bias monitoring, and red-team drills to maintain trustworthiness.
- **Scalable Deployment:** Containerize and orchestrate services across cloud clusters with auto-scaling, failover, and self-diagnostic routines.

## Next Steps
1. Review and adapt the prompt to align with current Sprint goals.
2. Prioritize foundational infrastructure tasks (vector store, RAG) and assign owners.
3. Draft a milestone plan mapping intermediate capabilities to upcoming game releases.
4. Set up evaluation benchmarks (response quality, delivery speed, safety compliance) to measure progress across tiers.

This document can serve as both a reusable prompt and a high-level roadmap for evolving Sentra AI into a comprehensive co-creator for Sigma’s game development efforts.
